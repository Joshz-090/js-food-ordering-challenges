## 🧩 Part 1: Simple JS Challenges (1–4)

This part is focused on **basic JavaScript practice**.  
Each challenge is short and beginner-friendly — great for understanding how JavaScript works with HTML.


then it include a ordering system

## 🚀 Part 2: Build Ordering System

Now it's time to use what you've learned!

1. Go to this site:  
   👉 [https://joshz-090.github.io/food-order-site-to-practice-js/index.html](https://joshz-090.github.io/food-order-site-to-practice-js/index.html)

2. Explore the design, then try to write your own JavaScript code that:
   - Adds items to the order
   - Calculates totals
   - Updates quantities
   - Removes items
   - Handles checkout logic

This part is more open-ended — you’re building the **real thing** now.  
You can do it all in your own JS file and test it out using the layout from the site.
